/**
    The purpose of the `ViewController` view controller is to provide a user interface where a fullname can be created by a first and last name, and to break a fullname into its components at the same time.
 
    There's a matching scene in the *Main.storyboard* file, and in that scene there are three textfields and two buttons. Go to Interface Builder for details.
 
    The `ViewController` class is a subclass of the `UIViewController`, and it conforms to the `UITextFieldDelegate` protocol.

        ### How it works ###
        If the `txtFirstName` or the `txtLastName` does not contain any text, the full name is not created. In any other case, the fullname is set to the `txtFullname` textfield once it's created.
    
        - Remark:
            It calls the `createFullName(_:lastname:)` custom method to compose the fullname.

            `createFullName(_:lastname:)`
